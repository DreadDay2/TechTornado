Project called TechTornado is a school project for a defense of practices. Idea of the project was to build a full online store like many famous for example as mediaexpert.pl obviously for purchasing and reviewing products. Project required to build a database, solid backend and nice to view style. The store is based on HTML stylised using basic CSS, JavaScript and PHP with SQL. It was the first large project which I have been working so of course it has some issues and it is not professional as someone could expect, but this project give me a lot of experience, self-development and ability of co-working. For example you can compare my latest project called Praktiker where you can see evolution of my skills.
